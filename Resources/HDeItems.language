Through the wreckage, through the silence it is.\n\nOh by the way, when are we planning on finally dropping Pony Express? I know they're cheaper than UES by a country mile but I swear at least fourteen percent of our stock has been lost by those assholes in the last 6 months alone. That's not even to mention the Tulpar shipment, which should have posted an update TWO MONTHS AGO. UES provides live updates for their freighter ships, what the hell is stopping Pony Express from doing the same?\n\nOh, sorry, give me a moment George the intern is on the coms.\n\n<style=cStack>What do you mean the Contact Light order was cancelled? Weren't they half way across the galaxy already?</style>\n\nI've got bad news George."
